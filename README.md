Martlet (Apus) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/alurin/martlet.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/alurin/martlet)
====================================================================================================================================

Capital attemtion to write programming language.

Goal
----
* OOP stack, e.g.:
    * Classes with multiinheritance
    * Overridable, overloaded and overplaceable method
    * Public and protected visibility
    * Extandable event-driven programming
    * Anonym function with closures and continues
    * AOP or metaprogramming
    * Component-entity

Building
--------
This project uses the Cross-platform Make (CMake) build system. However, we
have conveniently provided a wrapper configure script and Makefile so that
the typical build invocation of `./configure` followed by `make` will work.
For a list of all possible build targets, use the command `make help`.

NOTE: Users of CMake may believe that the top-level Makefile has been
generated by CMake; it hasn't, so please do not delete that file.

Installing
----------
Once the project has been built (see "Building"), execute `sudo make install`.
